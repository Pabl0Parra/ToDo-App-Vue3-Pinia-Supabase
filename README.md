### :unlock: WHAT DID I DO TODAY

<p>After carefully reviewing the documentation yesterday, I decided to first install Tailwind to implement some basic styles & responsiveness capabalities to the project.</p>
<p>I then move to create the database in Supabase so that the app can call data from it and send it as well, I also added an extra field for the task description in the database table.</p>

<p>Next, I started working on the authentication process:</p>

1. SignUp - html structure, gave it some styles & responsiveness, able to sign up to Supabase with email.

2. SignIn - html structure, gave it some styles & responsiveness, able to sign in to Supabase with email.

<p>Later, I´ve worked on implementing the logic to add new tasks to the project:</p>

1. Able to add new task to database - implemented logic to add new task to Supabase in the NewTask component.

2. Created basic html structure & styles to render new tasks on the UI.

1. ~~Style login component as well as signup component.~~

1. ~~Finish authentication process ➟ missing sign out capabality.~~

1. ~~Edit a task on the screen and update it on the database.~~
